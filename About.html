 <p> Tim Sheehan is a senior theater major at the Unversity of New Haven, looking to pursue a career in either acting, musical theater, voice over, or a combination of the mentioned four. He grew up in a small town called Bethel in Connecticut, where he had picked up music and theater at an early age in middle school, and carrying that hobby into a passion for the entirety of high school. Tim Sheehan has been nominated for an Irene Ryan Acting Award for his role of Ernst in Cabaret, and will be performing his last show next semester, in The Complete Works of William Shakespeare: Abridged.</p>

<p>Outside of theater, he is extremely passionate about videogames, tabletop roleplaying games, and eSports as a whole, helping to run the club sport eSports teams on campus. He also thinks anime is for total losers, despite being a big fan of anime. It's a "vicious cycle."</p>
